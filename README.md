# Advent of Code 2023
My first ever [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) WOW! :0

## Naming Convention
Each day is in a differnt folder. The scripts are named with the format of `Day day#.challenge#.gd` <br>For example: `Day 1.2.gd` is the script for the second challange of day one.<br/>

## Testing
- Create a [Godot 4.2](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2-stable/) project and assign the script to a Node.
- In the inspector of the Node, the **Puzzle Input** can be replaced or left as the challenge's example string.
- If you are replacing the **Puzzle Input**, make sure it is from the corresponding day and place a **carriage return** at the end.
- The solution will output into the console when the project runs.
