# Advent of Code 2023
My first ever [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) WOW! :0

## Naming Convention
Each day is in a differnt folder. The scripts are named with the format of `Day day#.challenge#.gd` <br>For example: `Day 1.2.gd` is the script for the second challange of day one.<br/>

## Testing
To test a script, create a Godot 4.2 project and assign the script to a Node. In the inspector of the Node, the Puzzle Input can be replaced or left as the challenge's example string. The solution will output into the console when the project runs.
